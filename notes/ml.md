# ML log

Owned by the ML person. Append only; newest entry last. Format per entry: date/time, what was built, files touched, what's next, blockers.

**Built:** `ml/scripts/download_data.py`, a Kaggle-notebook script that pulls a minimal subset of RipVIS from Hugging Face (`Irikos/RipVIS`, dataset) with `huggingface_hub`.
- Prints every non-video path from `list_repo_files` first, so the real layout is visible.
- Downloads only train/val `sampled_images.zip` and `yolo_annotations.zip`, `compute_pr_f1_f2.py`, and the val videos in `--val-videos`.
- Paths are matched from the file list (basename plus split folder token), not hardcoded. Any path with a `test` token is never downloaded, and videos come from val only.
- `--out-dir` defaults to `/kaggle/working/ripvis`. Existing downloads and already-extracted zips are skipped.
- Unzips each archive next to itself, then prints image and label counts per split, plus images without labels and labels without images (matched by file stem).

**Files touched:** `ml/scripts/download_data.py`, `notes/ml.md`

**Next:**
- Run it in Kaggle and check the printed layout against the matching logic.
- Pick the two rip demo videos and pass them via `--val-videos` (default is only `RipVIS-NR-004.mp4`).

**Blockers:** None. The script has not been run against the real repo; I only checked target selection against a mock file list.
